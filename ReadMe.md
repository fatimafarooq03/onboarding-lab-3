# Week 3 Lab: Verification

### exercise 2
I used seven different input values all within a different range in order to more comprehensively test the verilog module. These input values tested the module with the rest. I also incremented the input values over a range of 100 values in order to check without reset for a large number of values whilst also not increasing the runtime of the testing program too much. I chose this testing strategy as it allowed me to test through many numbers(100*7) while also from 7 different ranges which leads to a more holsitic and comprehnsive check of the module when testing all possible inputs is not possible
